I'm your self-hosted, cross-platform personal AI agent. You talk to me through **Telegram**, and I do the work on your computer. Unlike those fancy cloud AIs, I run on _your_ machine, respect _your_ privacy, and I'm always here - even on that dusty laptop in your closet.

**No subscription. No cloud lock-in. Just you and me.**

## 🎬 What Can I Do?

```
You: "Find all the PDFs in my Downloads and organize them by date"
Me:  *runs commands, moves files around*
Me:  "Done! I moved 23 PDFs into dated folders. Your Downloads is clean now!"

You: "Go to GitHub and star the PocketPaw repo"
Me:  *opens browser, navigates, clicks star*
Me:  "Starred! Thanks for the support 🐾"

You: "What's eating up my disk space?"
Me:  *analyzes filesystem*
Me:  "Found it! You have 47GB of node_modules. Want me to clean them up?"
```

## 🌐 Browser Superpowers (New!)

I can control a web browser for you! I see pages as a semantic tree and can:

- **Navigate** to any URL
- **Click** buttons and links
- **Type** into forms
- **Scroll** through pages
- **Take screenshots**

```
You: "Log into my GitHub and check my notifications"
Me:  *navigates to GitHub, sees login form*
Me:  "I see the login page. I found: textbox [ref=1], password field [ref=2],
      and Sign In button [ref=3]. Should I proceed?"
```

I use your existing Chrome if you have it - no extra downloads. If you don't have Chrome, I'll download a small browser automatically on first use.

## 🤖 Agent Backends

### Open Interpreter (Default)
Works with any LLM. I can run shell commands and Python code.

### Claude Code
Uses Anthropic's computer use. I can see your screen and control GUI apps.

Switch anytime in settings!

## ⚙️ Configuration

I store my config in `~/.pocketclaw/config.json`:

```json
{
  "telegram_bot_token": "your-bot-token",
  "allowed_user_id": 123456789,
  "agent_backend": "open_interpreter",
  "llm_provider": "ollama",
  "ollama_model": "llama3.2"
}
```

Or use environment variables:

```bash

export POCKETCLAW_AGENT_BACKEND="claude_code"
```
